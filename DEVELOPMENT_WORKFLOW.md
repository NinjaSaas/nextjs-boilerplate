# ninjasaas Development Workflow

This document outlines the development process and best practices for the ninjasaas team. As a paid developer on this project, you are expected to adhere to these guidelines to ensure efficient collaboration and high-quality code output.

## Development Process

1. **Task Assignment**

   - Tasks are assigned through our project management tool.
   - If you identify additional work, discuss with the team lead before creating a new task.

2. **Branching Strategy**

   - Our main branch is `main`.
   - For each feature or bug fix, create a new branch from `main`.
   - Use the following naming convention:
     - Features: `feature/issue-number-short-description`
     - Bug fixes: `bugfix/issue-number-short-description`
     - Example: `feature/123-add-user-authentication`

3. **Coding Standards**

   - Adhere to our established coding standards (refer to our internal style guide).
   - Use TypeScript for type safety.
   - Ensure your code is properly formatted using Prettier.
   - Follow React best practices and hooks guidelines.

4. **Committing Code**

   - Make small, focused commits.
   - Use meaningful commit messages that explain the "why" behind changes.
   - Reference the issue number in your commit messages.

5. **Pull Requests**

   - Create a Pull Request (PR) when your feature or fix is ready for review.
   - Fill out the PR template with all necessary information.
   - Request reviews from at least two team members.
   - Address all comments and suggestions from reviewers.

6. **Code Review**

   - Review PRs promptly when assigned.
   - Provide constructive feedback.
   - Approve only when all concerns have been addressed.

7. **Testing**

   - Write unit tests for new features and bug fixes.
   - Ensure all existing tests pass before submitting a PR.
   - Update or add integration tests as necessary.

8. **Documentation**

   - Update relevant documentation with any changes.
   - Include inline comments for complex logic.
   - Update the README if there are significant changes to the project setup or workflow.

9. **Merging**

   - PRs can be merged once they have two approvals and all checks pass.
   - Use "Squash and merge" to keep the main branch history clean.

10. **Deployment**
    - Our CI/CD pipeline will automatically deploy changes to the staging environment after merging to `main`.
    - Production deployments are manually triggered after QA approval.

## Best Practices

- Keep PRs small and focused on a single issue or feature.
- Regularly pull from `main` to keep your feature branches up-to-date.
- Communicate early and often about your work, especially if you encounter blockers.
- Use our team communication channels for discussions and questions.

## Team Communication

- Weekly team meetings on [specify day and time]
- Use [specify tool, e.g., Slack] for quick questions and discussions
